Story

The Argo is their only friend in the 
lawlessness of the mines. Argonauts constantly
battle with pirates and cretinous scavengers 
for survival. Nevertheless, with visions of
vast wealth, you decide to enter the fray.
The smiling salesman hands you the keys to 
your new ZX-24, and you head off into deep 
space. But can you hold your ground against
the chaos of the crystal mines?
